Lessons learned (at least one paragraph):
- There were three big problems that I had to overcome with this project, and learned from all three:
1) Access to Xcode. It was very difficult for me to work at the lab computers, mostly because the times I had available had a line of other students waiting to use them. So I resorted to using a macOS virtual machine, which I eventually got working after multiple days.
2) I put off this project to work on other classes. Unfortunately, it was a sacrifice that I chose to make. I was able to complete the project, but very last minute, and I had to work from my home computer. 
3) New environments: I was unfamiliar with macOS, VMWare, Swift, and Xcode. Put all of that together in a last-minute project and it was quite a crash course. I do feel more confident in my skills with all of those now.
