So what will I actually need for this?
X Create Main Activity view
X Create Task class
X create RecyclerAdapter class
- Create Add activity




- Viewholder for creating the individual recyclerview cells
	- so recyclerview is the overall view. I will only need one viewholder
	- should viewholder have an array of tasks? Yes
	- Viewholder should create a listview based on the size of the array of tasks
	- recreate the list every time a task is edited/added
- Create second constructor for Add activity for edits. Needs Add(editedItem)
